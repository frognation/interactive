We reconfigured and distorted slightly the familiar and oft-seen advertisements‚Äô main copies, images, and grammar structures to make large-scale advertising images that lacked the object of advertisement, and we screened it. 'OoH_MOVING IMAGE' is a 272.7187m by 20m, an image massive in scale. Would I ever make an image larger than this one? Further, would I ever appreciate it in real size? Probably not. You could feel out the real-size images in <a href="http://out-of-home.kr/">this website.</a>

      <p class="p1-3"></p>
      <img src="images/e16.png">

      <p class="p1-2">A sense of humor. The final design result might not reveal real jokes, but I think a humorous conversation during the working process is not only important but indispensable. Seriousness also works, but I often find answers in humorous conversations that loosens the atmosphere. üëΩ oh, and sweets at appropriate timings. ü§§<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  </p>

      <p class="p1-2">Unexpectedness. A sudden burst of sharp comments and ideas! I like her unexpected qualities, so I scarcely have time to be bored when working. What‚Äôs more, she often shrewdly points out important aspects after being so wacky. And that gap in her personality is surely thrilling.

I have never really lived my life imagining the future, but let me try. 10 years from now‚Ä¶we will be designing a new project or a business we wanted to realize, and have a fabulous breakfast at a perfect pancake house.

     <p class="p2-2"> For me, it was <i>2018 Perform</i> exhibition design.
      <i>2018 Perform</i> is an event on performance art and art based on temporality, and we expressed the impression we got from looking at the performances (as if preparing for a gig) by piling up eerie-looking bricks. We placed in different context the circular motif that differed in design each year (we designed for Perform 2017-2019), watching how it turns out, and the spontaneity of the process was fun.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br>
